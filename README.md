# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: SDK Build Tools Misconfiguration

This repository demonstrates a bug and its solution related to Android builds failing in Expo CLI due to issues with the Android SDK build tools. Even when the SDK appears correctly installed, the Expo CLI might fail to detect or utilize the tools correctly. This can be due to environment variable issues, conflicting SDK installations, or internal problems within the Expo CLI itself.

## Bug Description

The Expo CLI Android build process fails unexpectedly, even with the Android SDK seemingly installed correctly.  Error messages often indicate missing or misconfigured build tools, despite their actual presence.

## Bug Reproduction

1.  Ensure you have the Android SDK installed (including build tools).
2.  Attempt to build an Android APK using `expo build:android`. 
3.  Observe the build failure and error messages.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying and correcting the environment variables, potential SDK path conflicts and ensuring the Expo CLI is up to date.  In some cases, a complete reinstallation of the Android SDK might be necessary.  See the `bugSolution.js` file for a detailed example showing how to check and correct common issues.
