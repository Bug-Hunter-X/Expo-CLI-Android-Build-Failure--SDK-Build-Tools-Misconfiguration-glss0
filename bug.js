This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails with an error message indicating that the Android SDK build tools are not correctly configured or are missing. This isn't a simple missing dependency; sometimes, even with the SDK correctly installed, the Expo CLI might fail to detect or use it correctly.  This can be due to environment variables, conflicting installations, or issues within the Expo CLI itself.
